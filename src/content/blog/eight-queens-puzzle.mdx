The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an $8\times{8}$ （公式） chessboard 
so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the 
same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 （遮盖） solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th
century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programing 
techniques.
