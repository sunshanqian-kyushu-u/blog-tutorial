In this tutorial, we will learn how to build our own Astro blog inspired by the design of the 
**Fuwari blog**. 

<GithubCard repo="saicaca/fuwari"></GithubCard>

Our blog will look like [this](https://fuwari.vercel.app/).

We will learn to use Astro, Tailwind, Svelte and their excellent features. 
Let's start this exciting journey! 

# Hello, Astro!

Please refer to Unit 0 of [this tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) 
to the end of Unit 1. It will show you how to create your blog project and publish it to Netlify.

# Project Structure of a Fresh Astro Project

When you create a new Astro project with the empty template, you will get a minimal setup. 
Here are the most important directories and files:

src/

This is the main source directory of your project. 
All of your pages, components, and styles should be placed here.

src/pages/

Every files inside src/pages/ becomes a route on your site. Astro uses a file-based routing system.

Example: src/pages/index.astro -> /
Example: src/pages/about.astro -> /about

src/pages/index.astro

The default homepage of your site.

astro.config.mjs

The main configuration file for your Astro project.
