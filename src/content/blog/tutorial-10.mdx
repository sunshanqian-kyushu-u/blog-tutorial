In this tutorial, we will learn how to build our own Astro blog inspired by the design of the 
**Fuwari blog**, as the link below.

Our blog will look like [this](https://fuwari.vercel.app/).


Let's start this exciting journey! 

# Prepare your dev environment

## Terminal

You will use a **command line (terminal)** to create your Astro project. For Astro to 
run on your system, you need to have a compatible version of 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 

## Node.js

Astro supports **even-nunmbered** Node.js versions like `v18.20.8`, `v20.3.0`, 
and `v22.0.0`. (`v19` and `v21` are not supported.) To check whether you already 
have a compatible version installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bat
node -v

// Example output
v18.20.8
```

If the command returns a version number supported by Astro, you're good to go!


If the command returns an error message like `Command 'node' not found`, 
or a version number lower than the required, then you need to 
[install a compatible Node.js version](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). 

## Code Editor

Additionally, you will need to download and install a **code editor** to write your code. 

<Admonition type="note">
    This tutorial will use **VS Code**, but you can use any editor for your operating system.

[Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) or another code 
editor of your choice.
